Aim,Description,Example additions to model
1,Arrival processes and logic,Single and multiple classes of patients
2,Initial queuing logic and activities (delays),"Reneging, patient class dependent length of stay in a ward"
3,Separation of parameters from model logic,A configurable Experiment class to hold all model parameters. See Monks and Harper (2023)
4,Simulated trace control,Functionality to hide and display simulated events 
4,Patient routing ,Sampling to determine post ward destinations and activities
5,Additional queuing and activities,Additional treatment in a different hospital/ward
6,Results collection,"Audit and calculate ward occupancy, bed utilisation, waiting times etc."
7,Warm-up period,"Split the model run length into warm-up and results collection, reset all KPIs, introduce auditing processes."
8,Multiple replications,Multiple unique runs of the model. See Monks and Harper (2023)
9,Output analysis procedures,Charts and summary tables
10,Common random numbers,Allocate unique random number stream to each distribution
11,User interface,A web browser based interface for the model.
