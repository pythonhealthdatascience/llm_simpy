# Research Compendium: Replicating Simulations in Python using Generative AI

This repository serves as a **research compendium** for the paper:

> Monks, T., Harper, A., & Heather, A. (2025). **Unlocking the Potential of Past Research: Using Generative AI to Reconstruct Healthcare Simulation Models**. Work in progress. <!--TODO: Add URL-->

A research compendium is collection of all the digital materials relevant to the study. In this case, it includes a description of the aims and models, as well the STRESS reports for each model, the full model code and testing, logs of all the prompts used and experiences working with the LLMs, analysis of the results, and more!

This has been structured into a book which is hosted on GitHub pages and can be viewed at: https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/llm_simpy

## üåê Creating the environment

The project uses `conda` to manage dependencies. Navigate your terminal to the directory containing the code

```
conda env create -f binder/environment.yml
```

This will create a conda environment called `gen_simpy`. To activate:

```
conda activate gen_simpy
```

<br>

## üñ•Ô∏è Viewing the jupyter book locally

Once in the `gen_simpy` environment, navigate to the top level directory of the code repository in your terminal and issue the following command:

```
jb build .
```

This will build the HTML book locally on your machine.  The terminal will display a URL link that you can use to point your browser at the HTML.
