# STRESS report

It is often difficult to fully understand the design of a simulation model and how it has been implemented. To try and increase the transparency of our work we have followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (STRESS) guidelines for Discrete-Event Simulation {cite:p}`stress_guidelines`.  While we have attempted to be transparent we welcome queries, suggestions of clarification to improve the documentation.
