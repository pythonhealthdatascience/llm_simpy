    "## Plain English Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also includes an arrival and treatment process for elective patients.  In real life elective surgeries where a patient will require critical care post surgery are cancelled if there are no beds available.  In the model this is simulated in a simple way: elective patients are generated and as they arrive the model logic checks to see if any beds are available.  If no beds are available the elective patient leaves the model immediately - this is called \"balking\" in queuing theory. If beds are available the elective patient takes one and begins treatment.\n",
