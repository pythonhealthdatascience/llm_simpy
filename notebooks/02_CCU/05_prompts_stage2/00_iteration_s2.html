<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The first step in coding a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">simpy</span></code> model is typically coding the arrivals to the system.  In the CCU model there are unplanned (emergency) versus planned (elective) arrivals.  Given the logic for unplanned arrivals is the simpler of the two types it is logical to code the arrival of these patients (5 subclasses) first.</p>

<h3 class="rubric" id="general-model-logic">General model logic</h3>
<p>All time units in the model are in hours.</p>
<p>Each patient in the model has a unique identifier.  The first patient to arrive has an identifier of 0. For each subsequent patient increment the identifier by 1.</p>
<p>Patients to arrive at the CCU from five different sources: Accident and Emergency, the Wards, Emergency surgery, other hospitals, or the X-Ray department. Each source had a different inter-arrival time distribution.    After patients arrive they immediately leave the model.</p>
<p>All patient types must have their own generator function</p>
<p>The model should print out useful information after each event.</p>
<p>the model should include a user settable run length. This defaults to 12 months.</p>

<p>the interarrival time distributions and parameters of patients are dependent on patient type. For each distribution time is measured in hours.</p>
<p>Accident and Emergency = Exponential: 22.72

Emergency surgery = Exponential: 37.0
other hospitals = Exponential: 47.2

<p>This code sets up separate random number generators for each patient type using numpy.random.default_rng. It then defines five generator functions (accident_emergency_arrivals, wards_arrivals, emergency_surgery_arrivals, other_hospitals_arrivals, and xray_department_arrivals) that generate patient arrivals from the respective sources based on the specified exponential inter-arrival time distributions.
The ccu_simulation function initializes the simulation environment, starts the patient arrival processes, and runs the simulation for the specified duration (default: 12 months). The count function is a helper function that generates unique patient IDs.
After each patient arrival event, the code prints a message indicating the patient ID, source, and arrival time.
Note that this code does not include any additional logic for handling patients after they arrive, such as assigning beds or resources. It simply simulates the arrival process and prints the arrival information.</p>

<h2>Additional prompt:<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-prompt" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Could you re-factor the coding into a CCU class</p>
<p>In this refactored version, the CCU class encapsulates the entire simulation logic. The <strong>init</strong> method initializes the simulation environment, sets up the random number generators, and starts the patient arrival processes.
The count method is a generator function that generates unique patient IDs.
The accident_emergency_arrivals, wards_arrivals, emergency_surgery_arrivals, other_hospitals_arrivals, and xray_department_arrivals methods are generator functions that simulate patient arrivals from their respective sources based on the specified exponential inter-arrival time distributions.
The run method runs the simulation for the specified duration.
To run the simulation, you create an instance of the CCU class and call its run method.
This refactored version follows the object-oriented programming paradigm and encapsulates the simulation logic within the CCU class, making the code more modular and easier to maintain or extend in the future.</p>

<p>Modify the model to initialise the patient_id_counter = 0</p>
<p>In this modified version, the patient_id_counter is initialized to 0 in the <strong>init</strong> method of the CCU class. Additionally, in each of the patient arrival generator methods (accident_emergency_arrivals, wards_arrivals, emergency_surgery_arrivals, other_hospitals_arrivals, and xray_department_arrivals), the patient_id is assigned the current value of self.patient_id_counter, and then self.patient_id_counter is incremented by 1 after printing the arrival information. With this modification, the first patient to arrive will have an identifier of 0, and each subsequent patient will have an incremented identifier, as specified in the requirements.</p>

<p>Modify the model so that all patient arrival processes are inside the ‘run’ function. Show the full code listing. Do not hide any functions or classes.</p>
<p>In this modified version, the patient arrival processes are no longer started in the <strong>init</strong> method. Instead, they are started inside the run method.</p>
<p>The env.process method is used to start each patient arrival process, and the resulting process objects are stored in variables (accident_emergency_process, wards_process, emergency_surgery_process, other_hospitals_process, and xray_department_process). However, these variables are not used further in the code, as the processes run independently once started.
The self.env.run(until=self.run_length) line runs the simulation for the specified duration.
All other parts of the code remain the same, including the patient arrival generator functions (accident_emergency_arrivals, wards_arrivals, emergency_surgery_arrivals, other_hospitals_arrivals, and xray_department_arrivals), and the CCU class definition.</p>
