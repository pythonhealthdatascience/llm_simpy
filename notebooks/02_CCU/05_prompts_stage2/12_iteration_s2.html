<p>Here’s the modified code with the multiple_replications function added. This function is standalone and separate from the CCU class. It accepts an instance of Experiment and the number of replications (default=5) as parameters. The function runs multiple replications of the model, stores the results, and concatenates them into a single dataframe with the replication number as the first column.</p>
