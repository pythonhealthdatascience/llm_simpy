<p>create a function called “multiple_replications”. This should be standalone and separate from the CCUModel class. The function accepts an instance of Experiment and the number of replications (default=5) as parameters. The functions logic of each replication is as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>create a new instance of the model</p></li>
<li><p>call the reset_kpi function in the experiment</p></li>

<p>After all multiple replications have been completed concatenate all results into a single dataframe. The first column of the dataframe should be an integer representing the replication number. The function returns the results.</p>

<p>Here’s the modified code with the multiple_replications function added. This function is standalone and separate from the CCU class. It accepts an instance of Experiment and the number of replications (default=5) as parameters. The function runs multiple replications of the model, stores the results, and concatenates them into a single dataframe with the replication number as the first column.</p>
