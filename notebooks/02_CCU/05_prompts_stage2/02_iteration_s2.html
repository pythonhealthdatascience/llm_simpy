<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The model also includes an arrival and treatment process for elective patients.  In real life elective surgeries where a patient will require critical care post surgery are cancelled if there are no beds available.  In the model this is simulated in a simple way: elective patients are generated and as they arrive the model logic checks to see if any beds are available.  If no beds are available the elective patient leaves the model immediately - this is called “balking” in queuing theory. If beds are available the elective patient takes one and begins treatment.</p>
<p>This is the first test of more complicated logic for the LLM.</p>

<p>Add a new arrival source to the CCU: Elective surgery</p>
<p>Elective surgery patients are modelled as a separate process from the unplanned admissions, but share the critical care bed resources.</p>
<p>As an elective patient arrives to the CCU a check is made on the number of critical care beds available.  There are two outcomes from this check</p>
<p>Outcome 1: the number of beds in use is equal to the total number of beds available. In this case the elective patient leaves the model immediately. This is called a “cancelled operation” event and should be reported to the user.</p>
<p>Outcome 2. the number of beds in use is less than the total number of beds available. In this case the elective patient requests a critical care bed, is treated, and is then discharged. Before the bed is released for another patient there is an additional delay for intensive cleaning of the area and the bed.</p>
<h3 class="rubric" id="simulation-inputs">simulation inputs</h3>
<p>the interarrival time of elective surgery patients has a normal distribution with mean 17.91 and standard deviation 3.16.</p>
<p>the treatment time of elective surgery patients is exponential mean: 57.34</p>

<h2>Additional prompt required as diff 00-01 found that arrival messages were lost<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-prompt-required-as-diff-00-01-found-that-arrival-messages-were-lost" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Update the code to add an arrival message for each generator function. Add the message after the patient arrival counter addition assignment.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In this updated code, an arrival message is printed after the patient arrival counter addition assignment in each generator function. For example, in the accident_emergency_arrivals function, after assigning the current patient_id_counter value to patient_id and incrementing the counter, a message is printed indicating the patient arrival from the “Accident and Emergency” source along with the current simulation time.
The same pattern is followed for the other generator functions (wards_arrivals, emergency_surgery_arrivals, other_hospitals_arrivals, xray_department_arrivals, and elective_surgery_arrivals).
With these updates, the model will now print an arrival message for each patient, indicating the patient ID, source, and the simulation time when the arrival occurred.</p>
