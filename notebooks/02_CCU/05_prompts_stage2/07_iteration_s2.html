<h2>LLM Output 1:<a class="headerlink" href="#llm-output-1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The key changes are:
Added a self.total_unplanned_waiting_time attribute to the CCU class and initialized it to 0.
Added a self.total_unplanned_admissions attribute to the CCU class and initialized it to 0.
In the unplanned_admissions_process method, before requesting a critical care bed, the current simulation time is recorded in waiting_time. After acquiring the bed, the waiting time is calculated as self.env.now - waiting_time.
After the patient is discharged, if the simulation time has exceeded the warm-up period, the waiting time is added to self.total_unplanned_waiting_time, and self.total_unplanned_admissions is incremented by 1.
After self.env.run(until=self.experiment.total_run_length) in the run method, a new performance measure “Mean Unplanned Admission Waiting Time (hours)” is calculated as self.total_unplanned_waiting_time / self.total_unplanned_admissions if self.total_unplanned_admissions is greater than 0, otherwise 0.
Added the “Mean Unplanned Admission Waiting Time (hours)” result to the performance_measures dictionary.
The code now includes all patient generator functions in the CCU class and all code in the Experiment class</p>

<p>Modify the modified code as follows: restore bed utilisation as a performance measure as in the previously modified code.<br />

<h2>LLM output 2:<a class="headerlink" href="#llm-output-2" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In this modified code, the Experiment class stores all results collection variables, including the new performance measure “mean waiting time for unplanned admission”. The CCUModel class calculates the total treatment time for both unplanned and elective admissions, and calculates the new performance measure “mean waiting time for unplanned admission” at the end of the simulation run. If the simulation time has exceeded the warm-up period, the code collects statistics on the performance measures and outputs the results in a pandas dataframe.</p>

<p>Here we do a number of regression tests to check that previous functionality is not affected by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> class. We also update the test of run length splitting into two tests varying a results collection period and warm-up period.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Extreme value test 1</strong>: Wards, Em Surgery, other hospitals, x-ray have their inter-arrival time is set to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> a very large number</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: The only type of patient to arrive to the model is “Accident and Emergency.” <strong>NEW</strong>: there are 0 cancelled electives.</p></li>
<li><p>Actual result <strong>(PASS)</strong>: The only type of patient to arrive to the model is “Accident and Emergency.” <strong>NEW</strong>: there are 0 cancelled electives.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Extreme value test 2</strong>: All unplanned patient types have have their inter-arrival time is set to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> a very large number</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: The only type of patient to arrive to the model is “Elective.”</p></li>
<li><p>Actual result <strong>(PASS)</strong>: The only type of patient to arrive to the model is “Elective.”</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Different results collection period</strong>: The results collection period of the model is set to 10 hours.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: The model runs no longer than warm-up + result collection period = 720 + 10 = 730 simulated time periods</p></li>
<li><p>Actual result <strong>(PASS)</strong>: The model runs no longer than warm-up + result collection period = 720 + 10 = 730 simulated time periods</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Extreme value test 3</strong>: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">critical_care_beds</span></code> = 1</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: queues form after first arrival.</p></li>
<li><p>Actual result <strong>(PASS)</strong>: queues form after first arrival.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Extreme value test 4</strong>: means of stay_distributions set to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> a very large number.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: after 24 arrivals queues form and no patients are admitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Actual result <strong>(PASS)</strong>: after 24 arrivals queues form and no patients are admitted.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Vary warm up period</strong>: Vary the warm-up period while holding the results collection period constant.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: Run length is equal to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results_collection_period</span></code></p></li>
