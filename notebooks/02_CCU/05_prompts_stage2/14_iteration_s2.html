<p>Each statistical distribution used in the sampling should have its own random number stream.  This helps to avoid correlation across samples, allows repeatability of replications (using seeds), and can be used for common random numbers across scenarios.</p>
<p>The first stage is to create enough random number generators and store these in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> class.</p>

<p>Add a parameter to Experiment called “random_number_set” with default value 0.</p>
<p>Add a method to Experiment called “setup_streams”.  The method should accept an integer parameter called “random_number_set”.  “setup_streams” implements the following logic:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>creates a numpy random number Generator object using “random_number_set” as a seed. The generator is used to sample a list of 12 random integer seeds sampled from a uniform distribution with lower bound 0 and an upper bound equal to the systems maximum 64bit integer size.</p></li>
<li><p>Loops through “seeds” and for each creates a class level instances of numpy random Generator objects passing in each seed as a parameter.</p></li>

<li><p>The model had originally hard-coded RNGs which seemed to work okay until multiple replications were required.</p></li>
<li><p>On inspection, the model used the same seed for each patient pathway e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rng_wards</span></code> is used for the arrival generator, and also for the length-of-stay for patients who arrived via wards.</p></li>
<li><p>Identical seeds were used for each replication.</p></li>
<li><p>The initial prompt created the following function:</p>

<li><p>This creates specific RNGs for different purposes using the first 6 of the 12 seeds and assigns them to named attributes (rng_accident_emergency, rng_wards, etc.). It is more transparent, but also potentially unwieldy and inflexible.</p></li>
<li><p>The LLM was asked to add in RNGs for the two treatment processes.</p>

<li><p>These will be removed in a future iteration. This will require alterations to the treatment function RNGs.</p></li>
