<p>modify the code as follows:</p>
<p>Add in a new performance measure that is calculated at the end of the simulation run called “bed occupancy”. This is calculated by multiplying the bed utilization by the number of critical care beds.</p>
<p>Add the result to the pandas dataframe.</p>
<p>add a new parameter to Experiment called “trace”. The default value of “trace” is False.  If “trace” is True the model will print out simulated events such as admissions, discharges, or cancellations.   The model will always print out the performance at the end of the simulated run.</p>

<h2>LLM Output 1 stage 2:<a class="headerlink" href="#llm-output-1-stage-2" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The changes made are:
Added a new parameter trace to the Experiment class with a default value of False. If trace is True, the model will print out simulated events such as admissions, discharges, or cancellations.
Added a new performance measure called “Bed Occupancy” calculated by multiplying the bed utilization by the number of critical care beds.
Added the “Bed Occupancy” result to the pandas dataframe.
Modified the accident_emergency_arrivals, unplanned_admissions_process, and elective_admissions_process methods to print out events if trace is True.
When running the simulation, set trace=True to enable event printing.
The model will always print out the performance measures at the end of the simulated run.</p>

<p>In this modified code, the line bed_utilization = self.total_treatment_time / (self.experiment.num_critical_care_beds * self.experiment.results_collection_period) calculates the bed utilization as a proportion between 0 and 1.
The bed occupancy calculation remains the same: bed_occupancy = bed_utilization * self.experiment.num_critical_care_beds.
The performance measures dictionary now includes “Bed Utilization” as a proportion instead of a percentage.</p>

<p>Here we do a number of regression tests to check that previous functionality is not affected by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> class. We also update the test of run length splitting into two tests varying a results collection period and warm-up period.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Extreme value test 1</strong>: Wards, Em Surgery, other hospitals, x-ray have their inter-arrival time is set to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> a very large number</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: The only type of patient to arrive to the model is “Accident and Emergency.” <strong>NEW</strong>: there are 0 cancelled electives.</p></li>
<li><p>Actual result <strong>(PASS)</strong>: The only type of patient to arrive to the model is “Accident and Emergency.” <strong>NEW</strong>: there are 0 cancelled electives.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Extreme value test 2</strong>: All unplanned patient types have have their inter-arrival time is set to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> a very large number</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: The only type of patient to arrive to the model is “Elective.”</p></li>
<li><p>Actual result <strong>(PASS)</strong>: The only type of patient to arrive to the model is “Elective.”</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Different results collection period</strong>: The results collection period of the model is set to 10 hours.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: The model runs no longer than warm-up + result collection period = 720 + 10 = 730 simulated time periods</p></li>
<li><p>Actual result <strong>(PASS)</strong>: The model runs no longer than warm-up + result collection period = 720 + 10 = 730 simulated time periods</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Extreme value test 3</strong>: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">critical_care_beds</span></code> = 1</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: queues form after first arrival.</p></li>
<li><p>Actual result <strong>(PASS)</strong>: queues form after first arrival.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Extreme value test 4</strong>: means of stay_distributions set to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> a very large number.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: after 24 arrivals queues form and no patients are admitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Actual result <strong>(PASS)</strong>: after 24 arrivals queues form and no patients are admitted.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Vary warm up period</strong>: Vary the warm-up period while holding the results collection period constant.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected result: Run length is equal to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results_collection_period</span></code></p></li>
