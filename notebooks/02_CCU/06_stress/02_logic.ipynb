    "The model represents a Critical (Intensive) Care Unit (CCU). It consists of six classes of entity that arrive following varying distributions (note there is no time-dependency in this model).  The arrivals are either unplanned (emergency) or planned (elective surgery) who use a CCU that has a total of 24 beds.  Unplanned emergency patients are prioritised for critical care beds.  Elective patient balk (a cancelled elective operations) if no beds are available. Patient classes have their own treatment time distributions (length of stay in the CCU).  After discharge a deterministic bed turnaround time is included to allow for intensive cleaning. The aim of the study was to explore capacity requirements and related scenarios and their impact on the number of cancelled operations. A warm-up period and multiple replications are employed.\n",
