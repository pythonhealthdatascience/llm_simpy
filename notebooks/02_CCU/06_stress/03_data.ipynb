    "### 3.4 Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Griffiths et al. report that a Normal distribution could be used for modelling arrivals if the day is assumed to begin at 7am. It is unclear if this was the method used by the authors or if an alternative approach was used (e.g. empirical distribution function).  For simplicity we have assumed the Normal distribution reported in the manuscript.\n",
    "* Griffith's et al. does not provide details on the empirical distribution used for Elective length of stay. It is possible that raw data was re-sampled with replacement instead of constructing a continuous empirical distribution function. The manuscript does report the mean length of stay for elective patients. For a functional model we substituted the Exponential distribution for these patients.\n",
    "* Critical care length of stay for ED, emergency surgery and in-patient wards is listed as HyperExponential in Table 1, but full parameters are not reported. The main text reports that automatic distribution fitting software recommended LogNormal for these distributions. As the mean and standard deviation of the distribution is reported we assumed LogNormal instead of HyperExponential."
