These lognormal parameters are then used in the lognormal_to_normal function to convert them to the underlying normal distribution parameters (mu and sigma).

In this modified code, the lognormal_to_normal function is no longer called in the __init__ method. Instead, it is called within the unplanned_admissions_process method for each source. For each source, the lognormal_to_normal function is called with the corresponding lognormal parameters (mu and sigma) to convert them to the underlying normal distribution parameters. These converted mu and sigma values are then used to sample the length of stay from the lognormal distribution using the appropriate random number generator (rng_accident_emergency, rng_wards, rng_emergency_surgery, rng_other_hospitals, or rng_xray_department).\n",
    "The rest of the code remains the same, including the storage of the lognormal parameters in the __init__ method.\n",
    "This modification moves the conversion from lognormal to normal distribution parameters closer to where it is actually used (in the unplanned_admissions_process method), which can make the code more readable and easier to maintain."
