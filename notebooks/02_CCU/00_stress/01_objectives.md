# 1. Objectives

## 1.1 Purpose of the model

```{admonition} Primary purpose
The simulation model provides a formal framework for exploring the trade-off between Critical Care Unit (CCU) capacity, cancelled elective operations and queuing.
```

## 1.2 Model Outputs

At the end of a model run the following is calculated:

* Cancelled elective operations
* Utilisation of critical care beds (proportion of scheduled availability that a bed is in use).
* Mean waiting time of unplanned arrivals
* Bed occupancy
* No of arrivals

Mean results of these performance measures are generated using multiple replications.

## 1.3 Experimentation aims

A simple scenario based analysis.  The following experiments are included:

* Varying capacity between 23 and 28 critical unit beds.
