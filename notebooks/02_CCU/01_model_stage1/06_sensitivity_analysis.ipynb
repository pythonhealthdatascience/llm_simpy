    "# Sensitivity Analysis Script\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Transparency Note:** This notebook reports an analysis conducted as part of the **peer review** of an article reporting the work. **In summary, the findings of this sensitivity analysis do not alter the conclusions of our study. We were not able to replicate the results report, and there were no errors in the model generated using the LLM.** \n",
    "\n",
    "During the peer review of this work for the Journal of Simulation, a reviewer asked us to conduct a sensitivity analysis. This was because the results of our CCU model were different from the original journal article. There was a possibility that small changes in the parameters may calibrate the results between our recreation and the original model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three key sources of uncertainty were identified in the reporting of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The empirical distribution of elective inter-arrival times is not provided.\n",
    "* The empirical distribution (resampling of raw data) for elective length of stay in the CCU is not provided.\n",
    "* A&E, Ward, and Emergency Surgery patients length of stay are reported to fit both Lognormal (parameters available) and n-stage HyperExponential (parameters unavailable) distributions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of analysis conducted\n",
    "\n",
    "In response, we performed three types of analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis 1. One-way analysis of elective operations inter-arrival mean\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original study, the elective arrival process was modelled as an empirical distribution. We could not determine if the original model resampled the raw data directly or if an empirical distribution was constructed. An image of a relative frequency histogram of the elective arrivals is provided in the text, but the raw data behind it are not available. The authors state that a Normal Distribution with mean 17.91 and stdev 3.16 could be used as an alternative, although it was unclear if this was the actual approach used in the original model or if the empirical distribution was indeed used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original study states that the expected number of elective patients is approximately 30 per month, or 360 per year (roughly 1 patient per day). However, when we implemented the Normal distribution (mean 17.19 and stdev 3.16) in our model, we observed an average of 490 elective arrivals per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our model produced an average of 1,650 patient arrivals per year across all patient types (based on the mean from five replications). This aligns with the expected values calculated from the inter-arrival times provided in the original journal article, **as presented in the table below**. This table is generated based on the reported mean inter-arrival times for each patient type (see the IAT column in the table, as in Table 1 of the article). When these are then converted to annual rates, the total expected number of arrivals is approximately 1,649 per year:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Source**          | **IAT** | **Rate/day** | **Rate/year** |\n",
    "|---------------------|---------|--------------|---------------|\n",
    "| A&E                 | 22.72   | 1.06         | 385.56        |\n",
    "| Ward                | 26.00   | 0.92         | 336.92        |\n",
    "| Emergency           | 37.00   | 0.65         | 236.76        |\n",
    "| Other hospital      | 47.20   | 0.51         | 185.59        |\n",
    "| X-ray               | 575.00  | 0.04         | 15.23         |\n",
    "| **Unplanned Total** |         |              | **1160.07**   |\n",
    "| Electives           | 17.91   | 1.34         | 489.11        |\n",
    "| **Expected demand** |         |              | **1649.2**    |\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to highlight that, according to these calculations, the expected number of elective patient arrivals is 489 per year. This figure is notably higher than the 360 elective patients per year stated in the original article, indicating a discrepancy between the model's input parameters and the reported expectations for elective admissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original article reports an annual number of admissions as 1,341, along with 57 elective cancellations, in a 24-bed scenario. If we distinguish between arrivals (all patients presenting to the unit) and admissions (patients actually admitted), this suggests a total of approximately 1,400 arrivals per year in the original study. This is about 250 fewer arrivals than our model produces using the current parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate this discrepancy, we conducted a one-way sensitivity analysis on the mean of the Normal distribution used for elective inter-arrival times. **We found that, in order to reduce the number of arrivals to match the original article, the mean inter-arrival time would need to be approximately doubled—to over 35 hours between arrivals.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis 2. One-way analysis of Length of Stay means for A&E, Ward, Emergency, and Elective Patients\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors state that they chose Lognormal distributions for Length of Stay for A&E, Ward, and Emergency, but also mention that 3 and 4 stage HyperExponential distributions fit the data. The authors only provide mean and stdev, and not the parameters for the HyperExponential distributions. We therefore chose to use Lognormals in our recreation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the article Elective LoS is modelled by resampling from the raw data, but these data are not provided as supplementary material. However, the mean and standard deviation is provided. We therefore opted to use a Lognormal again.\n",
    "\n",
    "We varied the mean of these distribution by +- 50%.  **Our conclusions remained the same. The results were not reproduced.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis 3. Two way analysis of elective parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "We simultaneously varied elective inter-arrival times (20 up to 55 hrs) and elective LoS mean (+- 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The model is sensitive to an simultaneous increase in elective IAT and reduction in LoS. However, it does not get close to replicating results within reasonable values.** For example, the number of cancelled elective operations are still above 100 with a doubled IAT. For context, our model estimated over 340 cancelled operations using our original parameters. Meanwhile, the original article itself reported only 57 cancelled elective operations (Table 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**We suspect the main issue here is the shape of the distributions chosen. Our conclusion is that the lognormal distribution is a poor fit for elective length stay.**\n"
