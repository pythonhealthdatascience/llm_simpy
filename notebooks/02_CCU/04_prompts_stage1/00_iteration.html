<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The first step in coding a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">simpy</span></code> model is typically coding the arrivals to the system.  In the CCU model there are unplanned (emergency) versus planned (elective) arrivals.  Given the logic for unplanned arrivals is the simpler of the two types it is logical to code the arrival of these patients (5 subclasses) first.</p>

<p>Please code the full model specified. Do not return a simplified version. Show all code.</p>
<h3 class="rubric" id="general-model-logic">General model logic</h3>
<p>All time units in the model are in hours.</p>
<p>Each patient in the model has a unique identifier.  The first patient to arrive has an identifier of 0. For each subsequent patient increment the identifier by 1.</p>
<p>Patients to arrive at the CCU from five different sources: Accident and Emergency, the Wards, Emergency surgery, other hospitals, or the X-Ray department. Each source had a different inter-arrival time distribution.    After patients arrive they immediately leave the model.</p>
<p>All patient types must have their own generator function</p>
<p>The model should print out useful information after each event.</p>
<p>the model should include a user settable run length. This defaults to 12 months.</p>
<h3 class="rubric" id="simulation-inputs">Simulation inputs</h3>
<p>the interarrival time distributions and parameters of patients are dependent on patient type. For each distribution time is measured in hours.</p>
<p>Accident and Emergency = Exponential: 22.72

Emergency surgery = Exponential: 37.0
other hospitals = Exponential: 47.2
the X-Ray department = Exponential: 575.0</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The LLM both hard-coded the distribution parameters and created an instance variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inter-arrival_distributions</span></code> that stored them (but is never used).</p></li>
<li><p>The LLM made some reasonable assumptions about converting months into hours (assuming 30 days per month)</p></li>
<li><p>The model runs without error.</p></li>
