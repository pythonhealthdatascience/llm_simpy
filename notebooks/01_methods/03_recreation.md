# Model recreation

The study will follow an iterative approach to model recreation in line with the principal of parsimony. We will gradually add detail to the model in small increments as this mirrors how modellers code models.  Figure 1 illustrates this process for a traditional *manual* approach to recreating a simulation model from the literature without the aid of an LLM versus incorporating an LLM.
