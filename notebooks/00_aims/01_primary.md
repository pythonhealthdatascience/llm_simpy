# Primary aims

Our aim is to use LLMs as a tool to simplify, speed up, and add value to the process of recreating a simulation model reported in the literature.  We note that due to the time involved in coding a DES model, in many cases the lack of access to a computer model is a reuse barrier to an individual researcher or NHS professional with specialist simulation knowledge.   

This is early research to check that our proposal works in principle and pilot the approach with a small number of models. Our long-term aim is to provide guidance (e.g. the form and language used in queries), opportunities, challenges, risks to validity, and limitations in the use of LLMs to support recreating models to enable reproduction of results, models reuse and enhance education.

1. Given a description of a DES model, establish if it is feasible to use an LLM to generate a python and simpy model that is functional and passes verification tests designed by a human user.
2. Given a description of a user interface, establish if it feasible to use an LLM to generate a streamlit web app interface to a simpy model that can pass verification tests designed by a human user.
3. Pilot using a LLM to support the recreation of a healthcare DES model identified in the literature.
4. Pilot generating a contemporary user interface to increase accessibility.
