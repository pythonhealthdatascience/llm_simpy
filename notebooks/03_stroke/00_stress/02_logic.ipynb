    "\n",
    "The model allows users to specify a population of stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA; or mini-stroke), complex neurological, and other patient types that use acute and rehabilitation services. The patient classes have their own external inter-arrival distributions to acute and rehabilitation services, transfer probabilities between services and length of stay distributions (where first sub division occurs to model ESD versus non-ESD patients). The model takes an infinite capacity approach to capacity planning and estimates the probability of delay. A warm-up period and multiple replications are employed. The ESD modelling is not documented in the article we therefore chose to simplify the design and focus on the acute stroke and rehabilitation units; although we aimed for model setup to be simple to extend for ESD capacity modelling.\n",
