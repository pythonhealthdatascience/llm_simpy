# 4. Experimentation

## 4.1 Initialisation

The model is a non-terminating system. It has a default warm-up of 3 years (365 days * 3)

## 4.2 Run length

The time units used in the model are days and a results collection period of 5 years (365 days * 5)

## 4.3 Estimation approach

Multiple independent replications are employed to account for lack of independence. Common random numbers are employed between scenarios.  A total of 150 replications are run for each experiment, but this number can be varied.
