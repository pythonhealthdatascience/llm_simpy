To do


1. transfers from ASU to rehab
* ASU accepts an instance of rehab and store as member variable
* modify treatment functions to include a call to rehab.[patient_type]_treatment as a simpy process

2. Warm up period
* Modify Experiment to include a warm-up period variable (default = 5 years?)
* modify audit functions 
  * initial_audit_interval=warm-up period
  * asu audit function -> modify to pass in env (same interface as rehab)

3. multiple replications
    a. add reset_kpi method to Experiment that clears the occupancy lists
    b. convert scripts to single_run method
    c. multiple replication function
    d. summarise the results: convert to numpy array where each column is a rep and each row is number of patients in unit.  Average across columns.
