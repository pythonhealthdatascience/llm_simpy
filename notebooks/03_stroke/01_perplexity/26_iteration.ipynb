    "The LLM has generated code using a single numpy random generator stream `np.random`.  We will now begin the process of shifting to a model where each activity and sampling need has its own independent random number stream.  This will also allow for common random numbers to be used across experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create 25 random number generators and host these in the experiment class.\n",
    "2. Update the multiple replications function to switch between random number sets\n",
    "3. Update the `AcuteStrokeUnit` to use the first 14 random number generators\n",
    "4. Update the `RehabilitationUnit` to use the remaining random number generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Due to performance problems with Perplexity during this test we split the prompt in two: 26 and 26a\n",

    "> The `AcuteStrokeUnit` should not provide repeatable results for a given replication. A test has been added."
