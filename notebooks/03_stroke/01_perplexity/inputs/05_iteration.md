## Main command

Modify the code so that all model parameters are stored within a class called Experiment that is separate from the model's logic.  

The list of parameters include:

1. the means of the arrival distributions
2. the means and standard deviations of the lognormal distributions
3. simulation run length

The parameters should be passed to the Experiment class constructor method when it is created. please provide default values

Show all of the model code: this includes all patient generator functions in the AcuteStrokeUnit class.
