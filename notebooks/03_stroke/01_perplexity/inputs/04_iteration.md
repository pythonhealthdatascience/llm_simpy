### Main command

modify all `acute_treatment `functions to call a function external to the class called `normal_moments_from_lognormal`. The function should accept the mean and standard deviation of a Lognormal distribution and return the mu, sigma of the underlying Normal distribution. The returned values are the correct values to use when sampling from the Lognormal distributions.
