### Main command

modify all `acute_treatment `functions to call a function external to the class called `normal_moments_from_lognormal`. The function should accept the mean and standard deviation of the Lognormal distribution and return the mu, sigma of the underlying Normal distribution.  These returned values are the correct values to use when sampling from the Lognormal distributions.
