modify the `AcuteStrokeUnit` class as follows: create a member variable called `occupancy`.  Increment the `occupancy` member variable when a patient arrives to the ASU. Decrement the `occupancy` member variable at the end of the `acute_treatment` functions

add a new parameter to Experiment called "trace". The default value of "trace" is False.  If "trace" is True the model will print out simulated events such as patient arrivals and discharges.   The model will always print out the performance at the end of the simulated run.

output only the Experiment and AcuteStrokeUnit classes
