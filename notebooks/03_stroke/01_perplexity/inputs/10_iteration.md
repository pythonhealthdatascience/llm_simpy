code a function `calculate_prob_delay` that accepts the relative and cumulative frequencies. The function should calculate and return relative / cumulative frequency (prob_delay)

The prob_delay, unique values, a string called "x_label" (default value = "No. acute beds available"), and figure size (default = (12, 5)) should be passed to a function called `prob_delay_plot` that creates a matplotlib step chart of the prob_delay.  the x axis values are taken from the unique values parameter. The x axis ticks should run from 0 to 30 and all values should be displayed.  the x axis is label is set to the value of "x_label" Return the matplotlib figure and axis objects. 

Display the new functions and the script to create an experiment, run the model and creates the step chart.
