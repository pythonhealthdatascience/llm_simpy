Add a streamlit sidebar that contains a set of sliders, numeric text boxes, and check boxes that are used to set the parameters in an instance of Experiment. 

The following parameters that represent inter-arrival rates should be set. Labels are in brackets.

    stroke_mean (Stroke patients), 
    tia_mean (TIA patients), 
    neuro_mean (Complex Neurological patients)
    other_mean (other patients)


Add a section on the sidebar model control including the following parameters:

    trace (Trace patients in simulation)
    warm_up (Warm-up period)

the default values of slider and text boxes should be the same as those in the Experiment class.

In the main window add a numeric text box for the Number of replications used by multiple_replications.
