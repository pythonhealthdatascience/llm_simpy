    "After the interface to the model had been built we conducting some informal experimentation with the model. We found that our testing had omitted testing plotting code in experiments where the stroke arrival rate was very high resulting in high occupancies.  Our prompts to the LLM had \"hard coded\" up to 30 beds in the probability of delay and occupancy plots.\n",
