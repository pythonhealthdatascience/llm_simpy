<section id="plain-english-summary">
<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The Rehab unit is modified to include a count of occupancy.  This is incremented when patients arrive and decremented when patients depart.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We also include a prompt to update the rehab unit code to only print events if the trace parameter is set to True.
As we now have an occupancy count + trace implemented we will modify some of the formal tests.</p>
