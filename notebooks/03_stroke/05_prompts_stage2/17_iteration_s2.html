<p>The Rehab unit is modified to include a count of occupancy.  This is incremented when patients arrive and decremented when patients depart.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We also include a prompt to update the rehab unit code to only print events if the trace parameter is set to True.
As we now have an occupancy count + trace implemented we will modify some of the formal tests.</p>
