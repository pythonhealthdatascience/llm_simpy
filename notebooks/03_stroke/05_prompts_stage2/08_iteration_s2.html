<p>Create a new simpy generator function called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">audit_acute_occupancy</span></code> that accepts parameters <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">acute_audit_interval</span></code>, an instance of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AcuteStrokeUnit</span></code> called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">asu</span></code>, and an instance <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">experiment</span></code>.   The function repeatedly records the occupancy of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">asu</span></code> after <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">acute_audit_interval</span></code> time units.  The occupancy is appended to a member variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">experiment</span></code> python list called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">asu_occupancy</span></code></p>
<p>Output the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">audit_acute_occupancy</span></code> function, modified <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> class, and script to run the model and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">audit_acute_occupancy</span></code>.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">acute_audit_interval</span></code> should be set to 1 day.</p>
