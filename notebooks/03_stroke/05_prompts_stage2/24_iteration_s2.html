<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The LLM has generated code using a single numpy random generator stream <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.random</span></code>.  We will now begin the process of shifting to a model where each activity and sampling need has its own independent random number stream.  This will also allow for common random numbers to be used across experiments.</p>
<p>The steps are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Create 25 random number generators and host these in the experiment class.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the multiple replications function to switch between random number sets</p></li>
<li><p>Update the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AcuteStrokeUnit</span></code> to use the first 14 random number generators</p></li>
<li><p>Update the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RehabilitationUnit</span></code> to use the remaining random number generators.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This notebook focuses on step 1.</p>

<p>Modify the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code>  init method as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Add a new parameter called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random_number_set</span></code> with default value 0.</p></li>

<p>Add a new method to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setup_streams(random_number_set)</span></code> that accepts a parameter called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random_number_set</span></code>. It does not return any values.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setup_streams</span></code> logic is as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>create a member variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">streams</span></code> as an empty python list</p></li>
<li><p>create a numpy random default_rng generator object using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random_number_set</span></code> as a seed.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the generator object create a list of 25 random integer seeds sampled from a uniform distribution with lower bound 0 and an upper bound equal to the systems maximum 64bit integer size.</p></li>
<li><p>Loop through “seeds” and for each append a new numpy random default_rng object to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">self.streams</span></code> passing in each seed as a parameter.</p></li>
