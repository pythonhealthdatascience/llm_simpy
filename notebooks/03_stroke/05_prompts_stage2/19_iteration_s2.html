<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We now link the Acute Stroke Unit (ASU) and Rehab Unit (RU) models.  At the moment the models both work independently have have their own arrival processes. We will modify this so that the ASU can transfer patients to the RU when their acute treatment complete. This will be done in two steps. This notebook reports the prompt and results of step 1.</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Modify the ASU class to hold an instance of the RU. Prepare acute treatment functions to transfer patients labelled as “Rehab”.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify all ASU acute treatment functions to transfer patients to the RU if a patient is labelled “Rehab”</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: The new constructor for the ASU class means that all testing functions and scripts must now be updated.</p>
