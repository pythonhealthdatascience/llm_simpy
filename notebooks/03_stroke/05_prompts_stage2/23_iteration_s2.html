<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The second step of implementing multiple replications writes new code only:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Create a multiple replications function that calls <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">single_run</span></code> and stores run results.</p></li>
<li><p>Create three functions for combining replications and calculating the mean of the occupancy and prob of delay distributions</p></li>
<li><p>Create a function that produces a table summary of “probability of delay” and “1 in every n patients delayed” (to match paper).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These are standard python functions that are relatively simple we therefore included all of functions in the same prompt.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The tester writes the script to run all of these functions.</p>
<p>To simplify the notebook we remove the scripts to run ASU and Rehab models individually using scripts. Models are still tested individually in the formal testing section.</p>

<li><p>An initial prompt was used in this iteration to convert lognormal moments to normal moments and use it in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RehabilitationUnit</span></code> class.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Create a new external function called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lognormal_to_normal</span></code>, which takes two parameters, mean and standard deviation. Use it to convert onvert lognormal moments to normal moments in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RehabilitationUnit</span></code> class.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>This is added to the testing function</p></li>
<li><p>The ASU continues to use the conversion method in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PatientType</span></code> class</p></li>
<li><p>This iteration generated all new functions using the <strong>Stage 1 prompt</strong>. These are all listed below.</p></li>
<li><p>(TOTAL TWO PROMPTS)</p></li>
<li><p>Comparison of outputs with Stage 1 found an issue which could be easily missed when using LLMs to generate code, as the resultant rehab output is only slightly out. This was checked with Stage 1 tester, and a bug was found.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is to do with variables “patient_type” and what data type ASU and Rehab classes expect them to be. The ASU class uses “patient_type” as an instance of the PatientType class.  So the name of the type of patient is stored in the .name attribute.  e.g. “patient_type.name == “Stroke”. The Rehab class treats “patient_type” as a string instead of an object. So all “rehab_treatment” function includes “if patient_type == “Stroke” etc.  ASU passes the instance of the class rather than the name of the patient type. This does not cause an error because the if statement has an “else”.  This means that all ASU transferred patients are given a Length of Stay drawn from the “other” distribution (mean is half of stroke and hence you get a lower daily occupancy).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This will be modified in the next iteration.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, having started using PatientType objects for ASU, the rehab class would have also used PatientType objects instead of strings. This is an example of the LLM making suboptimal choices which can potentially lead to indetectable problems.</p></li>
