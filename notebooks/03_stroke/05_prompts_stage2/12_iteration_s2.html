<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We now begin to implement the rehabilitation process logic.  Arrivals to the rehabilitation unit can both be transfers from the ASU and arrivals from an external source.</p>
<p>To simplify implementation we will first create the Rehab unit separately from the ASU and include external arrivals only.</p>
<p>We add in two new extreme value tests for the rehab unit arrivals.</p>

<h3 class="rubric" id="main-command">Main command</h3>
<p>Add a class representing the process at a Rehabilitation Unit (RU) called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RehabilitationUnit</span></code></p>
<h3 class="rubric" id="general-model-logic">General model logic</h3>
<p>The RehabilitationUnit class should count the total number of patient arrivals.  The first patient to arrive has an identifier of 0. For each subsequent patient increment the identifier by 1.  The model should also maintain counts of the number of patients broken down by their type.</p>
<p>Patients to arrive at the RU from three different sources: Stroke, Complex Neurological, or Other. Each source had a different inter-arrival time distribution.  After patients arrive they immediately leave the model.</p>
<p>All patient types must have their own generator function.</p>
<p>The model should print out useful information after each event.</p>
<h3 class="rubric" id="simulation-inputs">Simulation inputs</h3>
<p>the interarrival time distributions and parameters of patients are dependent on patient type. For each distribution time is measured in days.</p>
<p>Stroke = Exponential: 21.8
Complex Neurological = Exponential: 31.7
Other = Exponential: 28.6</p>
<p>Add three class member variables for the mean of each distribution. For example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">self.stroke_iat_external</span></code></p>

<h3>LLM Output: Rehabilitation Unit class <a class="anchor" id="iteration_code_a"></a><a class="headerlink" href="#llm-output-rehabilitation-unit-class" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This implementation includes:</p>
<p>A RehabilitationUnit class that:
Keeps track of total arrivals and patient counts by type.
Has separate generator functions for each patient type (Stroke, Complex Neurological, and Other).
Uses the specified inter-arrival time distributions for each patient type.
Prints out useful information after each event (arrival and departure).
A run_rehabilitation_unit_model function that creates the simulation environment, initializes the RehabilitationUnit, and runs the simulation for a specified duration.
The main block runs the simulation for 5 years (1825 days).</p>
<p>This model satisfies all the requirements you specified:</p>
<p>It counts total arrivals and maintains counts by patient type.
Patients arrive from three different sources with different inter-arrival time distributions.
Patients immediately leave the model after arrival.
The model prints useful information after each event.
Inter-arrival time distributions are implemented as specified.</p>
<p>You can run this script to simulate the Rehabilitation Unit process for 5 years. The output will show patient arrivals and departures, along with running totals and final statistics.</p>
