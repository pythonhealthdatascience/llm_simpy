<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The length of stay (for stroke patients) is determined by post rehab unit destination i.e. ESD versus non-ESD. We therefore sample all post rehab destinations and then length of stay.  We do this for stroke, CN, and other patients. We exclude TIA patients as they do not have a generator method. This will be done in the next iteration.</p>

<p>Modify the model to add in three new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rehab_treatment</span></code> methods to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RehabilitationUnit</span></code> class each patient type i.e. Stroke, Complex Neurological, and other.  Prefix the method names with the patient type e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stroke_rehab_treatment</span></code></p>
<p>Show only the RehabilitationUnit class code: this includes all patient generator functions</p>
<h3 class="rubric" id="general-model-logic">General model logic</h3>
<p>Add the following logic</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>After a patient has been generated call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rehab_treatment</span></code> as a simpy process. Pass the patient type.  Do not use the yield statement when calling this method.</p></li>
<li><p>sample a post rehab destination. The options are ESD or Other. Store the result in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">post_rehab_destination</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>sample a length of stay (measured in days) for treatment of patients. store the result in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">length_of_stay</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>yield a simpy timeout equal to the length of stay for treatment</p></li>
<li><p>Print out information detailing the completion of a patient treatment.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="rubric" id="simulation-inputs">Simulation inputs</h3>
<p>The sampling distribution for post_rehab_destination is specific to the patient type.</p>
<p>Stroke = Discrete Empirical: 40, 60
Complex-neurological = Discrete Empirical: 9, 91
Other = Discrete Empirical 12, 88</p>
<p>the length of stay (measured in days) for treatment of patients in the RehabilitationUnit follow source specific distributions</p>
<p>if patient type = Stroke and post_rehab_destination = ESD then Lognormal: mean 30.3 and standard deviation 23.1</p>
<p>if patient type = Stroke and post_rehab_destination = Other then Lognormal: mean 28.4 and standard deviation 27.2</p>
<p>if patient type = Complex Neurological then Lognormal: mean 27.6 and standard deviation 28.4</p>
<p>if patient type = Other then Lognormal: mean 16.1 and standard deviation 14.1</p>
