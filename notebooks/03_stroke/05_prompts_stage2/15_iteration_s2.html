<p>In iteration 14 a number of the parameters of the rehabilitation unit are hard coded within the class. We now move the mean and standard deviation and routing probability distributions to the experiment class.  The rehab class is modified to reflect the changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We again split the output from the LLM into two parts using two separate prompts. We first limit the output to only display the Experiment class. We follows this up by only displaying the rehab unit code.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>This iteration allows us to add more tests of the Rehab unit model component. We add extreme value tests to prevent any patients leaving the Rehab unit.</p>
