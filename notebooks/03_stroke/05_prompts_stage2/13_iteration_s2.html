<p>Modify <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> class below. Add three new inter-arrival means for stroke complex neurological and other patient types. These should be called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rehab_stroke_iat</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rehab_neuro_iat</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rehab_other_iat</span></code>. These inter-arrival means should be passed to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> class constructor method when it is created. please provide default values using the values in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RehabilitationUnit</span></code>.
