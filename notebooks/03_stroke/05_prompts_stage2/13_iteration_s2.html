<p>We move the parameters from the RU class into the Experiment class to be inline with the design of the ASU class.  This change requires a rewrite of extreme value tests 5 and 6.  Two classes are modified <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RehabilitationUnit</span></code></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>During this iteration we found that the LLM had “forgotten” the Experiment and ASU classes.  We therefore provided the code for the Experiment class to the LLM and asked it to modify it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We provide a 2nd prompt (13a) to rewrite the script to run the Rehab model.</p>
