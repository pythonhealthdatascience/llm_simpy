<p>create a function in python called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">calculate_occupancy_frequencies</span></code> that accepts a python list of integer values. The function should use numpy to calculate the relative and cumulative frequencies of the numbers. The function should return a tuple containing the relative frequency, cumulative frequency, and the unique values.</p>
<p>The relative frequency, unique values, a string called “x_label” (default value = “No. people in ASU”), and figure size (default = (12, 5)) should be passed to a function called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">occupancy_plot</span></code> that creates a matplotlib bar chart of the relative frequency.  the x axis values are taken from the unique values parameter. The x axis ticks should run from 0 to 30 and all values should be displayed.  the x axis is label is set to the value of “x_label” The function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">occupancy_plot</span></code> returns the matplotlib figure and axis objects to the calling code.</p>
<p>The output should display the full script for creating a default <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> and running the simulation model. Modify the script as follows: After the simulation model experiment is complete the code should call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">calculate_occupancy_frequencies</span></code> and pass the “asu_occupancy” list as a parameter.  The code should then use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">occupancy_plot</span></code> and show the returned plot.</p>

<p>This script includes the following modifications:</p>
<p>Two new functions are added: calculate_occupancy_frequencies and occupancy_plot.
The run_model_with_audit function is modified to include the following steps after running the simulation:
Call calculate_occupancy_frequencies with the asu_occupancy list.
Call occupancy_plot with the calculated relative frequencies and unique values.
Display the plot using plt.show().
The necessary imports for matplotlib are added at the beginning of the script.</p>
<p>When you run this script, it will execute the simulation, print the results, and then display a bar chart showing the relative frequency of ASU occupancy levels. The x-axis will show occupancy levels from 0 to 30, and the y-axis will show the relative frequency of each occupancy level.</p>
