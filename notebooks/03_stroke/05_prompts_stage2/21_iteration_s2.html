<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We now add in a warm-up period for the model. This is implemented by modifying generators that periodically audit the occupancy of the models. An initial interval parameter (equal to the warm_up) is added.  No data is collected until after this time period.  We rename run_length to results collection period and all scripts to run the model are modified.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We split the prompt in two. The first modifies model logic. The second modified the three scripts that run the ASU, REHAB, and ASU+REHAB model respectively.
Testing updates: Several modifications to tests are also made to account for the updates. A new data collection test is added to check warm_up works as expected.</p>
