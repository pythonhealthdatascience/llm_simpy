<p>We now add in an audit of the rehabilitation unit occupancy variable.  We modify the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> class to store the rehab occupancy audit, create a new auditing function to run as a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">simpy</span></code> process. We issue a second prompt in this iteration to modify the script to run the rehab unit model.  This script uses prior functionality to generate probability of delay plots.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As per Stage 1, this was a difficult iteration for the LLM.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The LLM had “forgotten” the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> class in the first prompt, despite uploading the whole model, and returned only the parameters and functions requested.</p></li>
<li><p>It correctly added the member variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rehab_occupancy</span></code> directly after <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">asu_occupancy</span></code>and rehab_audit_interval after acute_audit_interval</p></li>
<li><p>The LLM had previoulsy added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">audit_acute_occupancy</span></code> to the Experiment class. With this prompt it chose to create a standalone function.</p></li>
<li><p>In most iterations we are allowing the LLM to make its own code style decisions, however this was amended with a simple prompt (PROMPT 3) to include <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">audit_rehab_occupancy</span></code> to the Experiment class for consistency.  It correctly returned the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> class and an example usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Prompt 18a returned an incorrect run method by attempting to intialise patient types as used in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AcuteStrokeUnit</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is a very clear example of where it is far simpler and less effort to code a function directly.</p>
