<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A small number of TIA patients are transferred to rehab from the acute stroke unit.  These patients are not admitted directly. Hence they only have a treatment method and no arrival generator method in the rehab class.  We add the treatment method here.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As this code is not run by any patient generator in the rehab class and the acute and rehab models are not yet linked we are unable to test this directly at this point.</p>

<p>Add a new method the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RehabilitationUnit</span></code> class to model TIA patient treatment called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tia_rehab_treatment</span></code>.
