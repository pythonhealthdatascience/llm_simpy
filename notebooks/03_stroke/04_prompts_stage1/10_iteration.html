<p>code a function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">calculate_prob_delay</span></code> that accepts to array-like parameters: relative and cumulative frequencies. The function should convert the parameters to numpy arrays and calculate and return relative / cumulative frequency (prob_delay)</p>
<p>The prob_delay, unique values, a string called “x_label” (default value = “No. acute beds available”), and figure size (default = (12, 5)) should be passed to a function called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prob_delay_plot</span></code> that creates a matplotlib step chart of the prob_delay.  the x axis values are taken from the unique values parameter. The x axis ticks should run from 0 to 30 and all values should be displayed.  the x axis is label is set to the value of “x_label” Return the matplotlib figure and axis objects.</p>
