### Main command

Add a new method the `RehabilitationUnit` class to model TIA patient treatment called `tia_rehab_treatment`. The method should have the same code structure as the other treatment methods in `RehabilitationUnit` and include print statements for events.

Do not add a new TIA patient generator method to the class.

Show only the `RehabilitationUnit` class code.

### Simulation inputs

The sampling distribution for post_rehab_destination of TIA patients is Discrete Empirical: 0, 100

the length of stay (measured in days) for treatment of TIA patients is Lognormal: mean 18.7 and standard deviation 23.5
