modify the patient_generator functions adding back in the sampling of `post_asu_destination` for tia, complex neurological and other patients. 

use the following data to sample Rehab, ESD, or Other destinations. 

TIA = Discrete Empirical: 0.01, 0.01, 0.98
Complex-neurological = Discrete Empirical: 0.11, 0.05, 0.84
Other = Discrete Empirical 0.05, 0.10, 0.85
