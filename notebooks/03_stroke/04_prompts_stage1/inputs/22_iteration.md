modify `Experiment` to include a method `reset_kpi` that resets the occupancy lists to empty.

modify edited script 3 into a function called `single_run(experiment)`.  The first line of code should call experiment.reset_kpi(), In a dictionary, return the relative frequencies, prob of delay, and unique values for asu and rehab 

Using script 3 code a new script that creates an instance of `Experiment`, uses `single_run` and prints out a `prob_delay_plot` for both asu and rehab 

show all code in `Experiment`, `single_run`,  the new script
