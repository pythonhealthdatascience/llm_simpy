<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Between iteration 2 and 3 the LLM “forgot” to include some of the code for sampling post ASU destination. This was only tested for stroke patients as it effected length of stay and was subsequently missed in further regression testing. This iteration asks the LLM to add the code back in with a simple prompt repeating the parameters.</p>
<p>We also modify the workflow to now include a formal diff of the notebooks.  The notebook format will be rearranged into different sections for each function and each class (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AcuteStrokeUnit</span></code> sections and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Experiment</span></code> section) going forward to allow for code to be easily replaced and the diffed.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nbdime</span></code> for diffing jupyter notebooks.  This allows us to render the diff as HTML and include in our Jupyter book. All diffs are stored as html <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/diffs</span></code></p>
