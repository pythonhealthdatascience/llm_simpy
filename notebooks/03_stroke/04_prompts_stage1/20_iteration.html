<p>This is the second step of linking the Acute Stroke Unit (ASUU) and Rehab Unit (RU) models.  Here we enable transfers between models and also create a script to run both models (completed in a second prompt that does not affect model logic).</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Modify the ASU class to hold an instance of the RU. Prepare acute treatment functions to transfer patients labelled as “Rehab”.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify all ASU acute treatment functions to transfer patients to the RU if a patient is labelled “Rehab” (This notebook)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: The new constructor for the ASU class means that all testing functions and scripts must now be updated.</p>
