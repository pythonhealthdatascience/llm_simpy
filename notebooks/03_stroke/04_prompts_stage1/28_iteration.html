<p>We now add a simple <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">streamlit</span></code> dashboard as a user interface to the model.  We do this by providing the LLM with a model run script and iteratively asking it to modify the script to add in more <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">streamlit</span></code> features. In this first <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">streamlit</span></code> iteration we:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Assume that all model functions/class in the run script are in a python module called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stroke_rehab_model</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a main window and that provides a button to run the model (via the supplied script)</p></li>
<li><p>Provide run time feedback and display tabular and plot results to the user.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: we do not add any formal tests at this stage nor do we difference the code as no changes to the model were requested. We assessed the work, by running the streamlit interface.</p>
