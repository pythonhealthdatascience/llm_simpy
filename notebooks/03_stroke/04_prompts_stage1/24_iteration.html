<h2>Plain English Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#plain-english-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The LLM has generated code using a single numpy random generator stream <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.random</span></code>.  We will now begin the process of shifting to a model where each activity and sampling need has its own independent random number stream.  This will also allow for common random numbers to be used across experiments.</p>
<p>The steps are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Create 25 random number generators and host these in the experiment class.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the multiple replications function to switch between random number sets</p></li>
<li><p>Update the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AcuteStrokeUnit</span></code> to use the first 14 random number generators</p></li>
<li><p>Update the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RehabilitationUnit</span></code> to use the remaining random number generators.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This notebook focuses on step 1.</p>
