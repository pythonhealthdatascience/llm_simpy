Released to submit as revision 1 based on requests from reviewers at the Journal of Simulation.

### Changed

* environment file now includes seaborn
* Automated testing now has  more tests to increase code coverage to 100%
* Jupyter book updated to reflect revisions including sensitivity analyses.

### Added

* A detailed one and two way sensitivity analysis of the stage 1 CCU model (new notebook)
* `pytest` coverage statistics for LLM generated code.
* Add statistical tests comparing Stage 1 and Stage 2 models (paired-t)

### Fixed

* Minor bug in the example script for the running the CCU stage 1 model
* Duplicate/redundant arrival generating method removed from `PatientType` class in stage 2 stroke model (not used when running the simulation).
